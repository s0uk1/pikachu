## :computer: How to run (assuming anyone would willingly want to run this mess)



The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and mlx w s7abatha to run.

when compiling the code, add the source file and the required flag:

```shell
gcc pikachu.c -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit
```
